This is a hackernews clone built using `React` and `Apollo Client`. It has features like displaying a list of links, signup and authentication, creating new links, voting on links, pagination as well as realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions.

The backend was powered by `graphql-yoga`, a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of `Express.js`, and resolvers were built using `Prisma` client.

To start this, take a clone of the repo. Go into server folder do `npm i`, and run `npm start` this runs your server. Similarly install npm in the root directory and run npm install, this renders your react app in the browser. You might need to create an account on prisma.

This has been built following the tutorial on [`howtographql`](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo)
